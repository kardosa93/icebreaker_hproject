Developing an Icebreaker and Examining its Impact on Social Behaviour

The developed game is based on the sequence of questions and the answers given by the players. The players who have chosen the same topic will get into the same gameplay. During the rounds, everybody receives the same questions; this is crucial. After sending the answers, the program displays all of them on one next screen and the discussion can begin. The replies can be commented on and liked by the players (they get points for interactions).  The prototype was created using Phaser - HTML5 game framework written in JavaScript.
